This document describes how lessons work, and how you can add your own. 
Lessons should be added to the fly/data/lessons directory.

=== INTRODUCTION ===

A lesson file is a text file with extension ".les", which contains words for 
the user to type when the game is running in Lesson Mode. Each lesson file has 
a corresponding ".chd" file, which contains the chords for the text in the 
lesson file. The game will generate a ".chd" if this is missing, so if you 
make a change to the lesson, you need to delete the ".chd" file so that it's 
regenerated.

=== SPECIFYING OPTIONS FOR LESSON FILES ===

On the first line of each lesson file, you can specify the options you want
for retrieving the words and displaying them. Available options for retrieval 
are:
* randomize
* introduce_increment
* in_order
You may only use ONE of these options. If more than one is specified, the last 
one will be used.

Available options for display are:
* word
* sentence
You may only use ONE of these options. If more than one is specified, the last 
one will be used.

You should specify these in angle brackets, such as:
<randomize, word>
or 
<in_order, sentence>

If the options are omitted, default options of <in_order, word> will be used.

=== WHAT THE OPTIONS ARE ===

RETRIEVAL OPTIONS (use one of these)
* randomize: 
Retrieve words at random for the user to type.

* introduce_increment:
Start with a minimum of words, and add extra words when the user meets 
accuracy/speed requirements (see fly/config.py for how to set the 
requirements). Extra words are removed if the user doesn't meet requirements, 
but the base words are always available.

* in_order:
Display the words to type in order, one at a time. The user must type a word 
correctly before he/she can go on to the next word. When the last word is 
reached, the lesson starts again at the beginning.

DISPLAY OPTIONS (use one of these)
* word:
One word at a time is displayed on the screen for the user to type.

* sentence:
An entire sentence is displayed on the screen for the user to type.
NOTE: This is currently only supported for in_order retrieval.

=== WHEN ADDING LESSONS ===

* The name of the lesson file will be used in the GUI as the name of the 
lesson, but underscores in the lesson name will be transformed into spaces. For
example, if a lesson file exists called magic_words.les, in the GUI this will 
become: Magic Words. NOTE: Keep the lesson name short, or the full name will 
not appear in the GUI.

* When adding a lesson that will be used with the sentence display mode, 
restrict sentence length to less than or equal to 48 columns, otherwise it 
will not fit in the UI.

* The process of translating a lesson to a ".chd" file containing chords is 
not fully developed, and may not translate all words correctly. Also, some 
words may not be defined in the dictionary. In these cases, the translation 
will be the fingerspelled word. Translation files can also be edited manually 
if the translation process is not generating the chords that you want to 
display.  
* Once you've added the lesson to the data/lessons directory it will become 
available in the GUI by entering Lesson Mode and clicking ">" until the name of
your lesson appears.
