    * Suspends translation when losing window focus, so that users can
      type using qwerty in other windows while running Fly
    * Support for other steno machines, by using the same discovery method
      plover is using
    * Docs updated to note xlib is needed if plover has not been installed
    * Steno colour overlay option, where groups of keys such as HR are
      coloured according to the steno grid image, in this case cyan for L.
    * Returns random chord rather than easiest for uncategorized chords.
    * Left shift key will toggle hint options on or off. Hint options can 
      be set in config.py.

      appear in lessons. In word mode, only canon strokes or uncategorized 
      strokes will be presented.
    * Any chord can be used that produces the correct translation, not just 
      the one presented to the user.
    * "Briefs" lesson added, that contains only briefs from word
      categorization dictionary.
